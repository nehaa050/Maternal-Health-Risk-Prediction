This dataset consists of 1014 rows and 7 columns. In the dataset, each row represents an individual's health profile, and the columns contain the following information:

Age: Age of the individual in years.

SystolicBP: Systolic blood pressure reading in mmHg.

DiastolicBP: Diastolic blood pressure reading in mmHg.

BS: Blood sugar level in mg/dL.

BodyTemp: Body temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

HeartRate: Heart rate in beats per minute.

RiskLevel: Assigned risk level based on the individual's health parameters (e.g., high risk, low risk, mid risk).
